## Created By

Hi, I'm Matthew Nuzum, a web developer and professional trainer who has taught classes on web design in general and web development with Node.js. 

I've watched users struggle to get started with Node.js and I'd like to make it easier. I'm helping do this by writing tutorials, creating training material, and providing in-person training.

I think we can do more by working with the tools.

I love the simplicity and flexibility of Express.js and would like to see projects that simplify common tasks without changing the nature or semantics. Projects created with express-simple will work just like any other Express.js project, including the use of existing tutorials.
